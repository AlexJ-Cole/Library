LIBWAWY

A library app that allows users to create new book entries (Title, Author, Pages, Read(or not)) that are stored as objects in an array (myLibrary) and displays contents of the array as a table using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

TODO:
- Add local storage solution
- Add button that copies any given object to clipboard
- Add more book info?
